    {Senior Associate Consultant}%
    {at}%
    {Infosys Pune}%
    {Migrated a legacy PL/I-based monolithic tool to a modern Spring Boot architecture, ensuring full feature parity and enabling efficient large-scale data processing.

    Engineered custom collection-based structures and fine-tuned resource configurations to prevent heap overflow, achieving \skill{5–10\%} faster high-volume sorted data operations.
  
    Introduced advanced Java parallel streams and ForkJoinPool-based multithreading, alongside improved garbage collection strategies, significantly enhancing scalability and stability.
  
    Integrated Redis for high-speed data access and leveraged the Executor Framework to enable asynchronous DB-intensive operations, boosting throughput and minimizing runtime bottlenecks.
  
    Employed thread-safe collections and implemented explicit cleanup routines before runs, achieving a \skill{97\% performance improvement} by reducing response time from \skill{800K ms to 25K ms}.
  
    Designed and implemented an AWS-based CI/CD pipeline to support seamless automated deployments, ensuring high availability and rapid delivery for the modernized architecture.}

    {Systems Engineer}%
    {at}%
    {Tata Consultancy Services Mumbai}%
    {Designed and optimized robust REST APIs using Spring Boot to transform and migrate user data, integrating advanced Spring caching and ORM techniques to significantly reduce database query times, resulting in a \skill{10\%} performance improvement.

    Engineered large-scale data processing pipelines using the Apache POI library, efficiently writing \skill{millions of rows} of data into Excel files and automating secure uploads to Box cloud storage via Box SDK and JWT-based authentication.
  
    Developed advanced refire logic combined with a RabbitMQ-based asynchronous microservices architecture, enabling seamless resumption and migration of failed setups from the exact point of failure, reducing recovery and migration time by \skill{50\%}.
  
    Successfully migrated over \skill{40k user setups \& 15TB+ of data} to next-gen applications and Box within a compressed timeline, achieving a \skill{98\% success rate} and delivering over \skill{\$5M+} cost savings for the client.
